Simple multichannel POCSAG receiver, to be used with osmo-pocsag (https://github.com/smunaut/osmo-pocsag)
The script decode-streams automatically starts 4 istances of the pocsag decoder (whose executable should be in the same folder as the script)
In alternative, you can specify the four fifos in the grc file and decode them using your own decoder/osmo-pocsag
I absolutely do not guarantee that this decoder will work. 
The center frequencies correspond to the 4 swiss POCSAG channels, you need to change it to those of your country.
